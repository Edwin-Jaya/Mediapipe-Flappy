# 🕊️ Mediapipe-Flappy  

> **Jump IRL. Fly in-game.**  

---

## 🎮 What’s This?
A *flappy bird* clone with a twist:  
Built with **Python**, **Pygame**, and **Mediapipe**, this game lets **your body movement** control the bird.  
Yes, you **literally jump** to keep it flapping! 🕺💃

---

## 🚀 How to Play
1. **Stand up.**  
2. **Jump.** (Seriously, that’s it.)  
3. Watch your on-screen bird flap as you bounce like a happy pigeon.  

Tip: The higher you jump, the longer you’ll *probably* last.
